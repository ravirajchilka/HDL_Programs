# What's VHDL?
Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a description language used to describe hardware. ASICs or FPGAs can be programmed using VHDL. Microcontrollers/CPUs execute instructions line by line whereas FPGA doesn't have any instruction set, it's just pure digital hardware for this reason FPGA can perform multiple tasks at the same time in parallel manner. The code written in VHDL, Verilog runs parallelly, not sequentially. Most of the companies are using Verilog and SystemVerilog however learning VHDL helps to understand hardware better. After getting good at VHDL other HDLs can be learned and encouraged to learn.
