# What's VHDL or Verilog?
Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL), Verilog are description languages used to describe(build) hardware. ASICs or FPGAs can be programmed using VHDL,Verilog. Microcontrollers/CPUs execute instructions line by line whereas FPGA doesn't have any instruction set, it's just pure digital hardware. For this reason, FPGA can perform multiple tasks at the same time in a parallel manner. The code written in VHDL, Verilog, runs parallel, not sequentially as it's used to build hardware. FPGA/ASIC plays a super important role in high performance computing. Hardware acceleration for ML and AI based models can be modeled using FPGA. Google's TPU is one of the example of ASIC.
