# What's VHDL?
Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a description language used to describe hardware. ASICs or FPGAs are programmed
using VHDL. Most of the companies are using Verilog and SystemVerilog instead VHDL as VHDL is verbose and has steep learning curve, however learning VHDL
helps to understand hardware better. After getting good at VHDL other HDLs can be learned and encouraged to learn.
