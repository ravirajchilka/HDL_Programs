# What's VHDL?
Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a description language used to describe hardware. ASICs or FPGAs are programmed
using VHDL. Microcontrollers/CPUs execute instructions line by line whereas FPGA doesn't have any instruction set, it's just pure digital hardware for this reason FPGA can perform multiple tasks at the same time in parallel manner. The code written in VHDL, Verilog etc. run in parallelly not sequentially. Most of the companies are using Verilog and SystemVerilog instead VHDL as VHDL is verbose and has steep learning curve, however learning VHDL
helps to understand hardware better. After getting good at VHDL other HDLs can be learned and encouraged to learn.
