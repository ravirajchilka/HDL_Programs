Whats VHDL?
Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a description language used to describe hardware. ASICs or FPGAs are programmed
using VHDL. Most of the companies are using Verilog and Systemverilog instead VHDL as VHDL is verbose and has steep learning curve, however learning VHDL
helps to understand hardware better.
