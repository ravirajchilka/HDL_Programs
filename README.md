# What's VHDL?
Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a description language used to describe hardware. ASICs or FPGAs can be programmed using VHDL. Microcontrollers/CPUs execute instructions line by line whereas FPGA doesn't have any instruction set, it's just pure digital hardware. For this reason, FPGA can perform multiple tasks at the same time in a parallel manner. The code written in VHDL, Verilog, runs parallel, not sequentially as it's used to describe hardware. FPGA/ASIC plays a super important role in high performance computing. Hardware acceleration for ML and AI based models can be modeled using FPGA. Google's TPU is one of the example of ASIC. Most companies are using Verilog and SystemVerilog, but learning VHDL helps to understand hardware better. After getting good at VHDL, other HDLs can be learned and encouraged to learn.
